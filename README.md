# Missionaries Cannibals

The missionaries and cannibals problem is a classic river crossing logic puzzle.
You can find the description in this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem).

The package I used in the project was [AIMA](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python/) which is based on the Russell And Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach" book.

This project was a part of my Artificial intelligence course at college.
## Usage

```commandline
python main.py
```
